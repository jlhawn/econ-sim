banking

There will be a single central bank responsible for managing demand deposit
accounts and loans for all persons. The bank's reserves start equal to the
sum of all deposits, perfectly balancing assets and liabilities. The reserves
to deposits ratio is 1.

        Assets | Liabilities
    ===========|=============
    --Reserves-|-Deposits----
     1,000,000 | 1,000,000

    Reserves/Deposits Ratio: 1.0

When the bank issues a loan, a new leveraged asset representing the loan balance
is created on the bank's balance sheet. At the same time, the loan balance is
added to the borrower's account on the liabilities side of the balance sheet.
The total deposits in the bank have now increased by the loan amount but the
banks's reserves have not changed. This reduces the bank's reserves ratio to 0.99.

        Assets | Liabilities
    ===========|=============
    -----Loans-|-Deposits----
        10,000 | 1,010,000
    --Reserves-|
     1,000,000 |

    Reserves/Deposits Ratio: 0.9900990099

When the borrower pays back the loan with a payment of $10,500 this payment is
divided into principle and interest. Of this payment, $500 goes to interest while
the remaining $10,000 goes to pay off the loan balance. The $500 of interest is
seen on the central bank's balance sheet as profit.

        Assets | Liabilities
    ===========|=============
    -----Loans-|-Deposits----
             0 | 999,500
    --Reserves-|-Profits-----
     1,000,000 | 500

    Reserves/Deposits Ratio: 1.0005002501

These profits may be distributed back to deposit holders proportionally as a
dividend or may simply be transferred to the bank's reserves, serving to increase
its reserves to deposits ratio, allowing it to make even more loans.
