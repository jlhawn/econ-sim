- site preparation
  - clear the site of any existing buildings
  - workers deconstruct the existing building, yielding waste resources
- construction phase
  - workers and materials are brought to the site and a set amount
    of work is performed to construct the building. The amount of time
    varies by type and size of building but can take several weeks.
- finishing phase
  - equipment is transported away from the site
