ownership & subdivision

Every hex tile is about 1000 square meters, ~10,000 sqft, or ~0.25 acre. An
entire grid with a radius of 128 hex tiles is ~50 square kilometers.

A separate piece of owned property is termed a "parcel". A parcel is contained
on a "lot". There may be many parcels to a lot but there is at least one. A lot
corresponds to actual grid area. A lot is composed of at least one hex tile but
may be composed of multiple neighboring hex tiles. A lot is never composed of
partial hex tiles, only multiples of whole tiles. If a lot is composed of more
than one hex tile, one tile is designated as its "frontage" tile. The frontage
for a lot of a single tile is that single tile. The frontage tile is used for
measuring distance to other lots and so can be thought of as the entrance and
exit of a lot.

A lot is also how we account for buildings and developments. A lot may only
contain a single building/development. A lot with multiple parcels will only be
common for high-density commercial or residential lots which may have multiple
units of housing or commercial space. Industrial lots only have one building.
