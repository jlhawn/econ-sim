# Balance of Maximizing Utility

Thoughts from http://www.henrygeorge.org/def2.htm

you would think that the economy would find some sort of balance
in which 4 essential things are divided equally among 100 people
with 25 people each assigned to production. 1 person is able to
produce enough of that thing to meet the needs of themself and
3 other people.

	25 people produce 100 units of A
	25 people produce 100 units of B
	25 people produce 100 units of C
	25 people produce 100 units of D

here, everyone has their needs met and earns a living producing
their respective items. This "ideal" is far from how the real
world operates, however. What if the production of one item
becomes more efficient such that only 20 people are needed to
produce 100 units? What is done with the extra surplus of 25
items? Or what would these extra 5 people do? There must be
*something* else that people want beyond the original set of 4
items? If the production of that item doesn't change, what
happens if there is population growth?

Perhaps the original assumption is wrong - people will not
be satisfied with only 1 unit of each item, they will want
ever more to satisfy their unlimited desires (as long as
they still have time to appreciate them).

People will always try to maximize their subjective utility, each
person having unique relative preferences for different items. They
are only limited by time and space constraints - so they would of
course prefer to work as little as possible at higher-paying jobs
to have more time and money to purchase and do more things.
